intro: |
  Recently, I went to [The Friendly Toast](http://thefriendlytoast.com/) in Cambridge and had biscuits and gravy for the first time in my life. I have no idea how I went this long without having such a classic meal, but fortunately fate seems to have been on my side that day. It's now my #1 favorite breakfast.

  My fianc&eacute;e recently became vegetarian, so I knew when I made this at home I'd have to use vegetarian sausage. Veggie sausage is surprisingly good. I think it has to do with the fact that 90% of the appeal of sausage patties comes from the spices that are included. I tried some while I was heating it up in the pan and was surprised at how much like real sausage it tasted.

# Preparation

Prepare the {biscuits}[prepackaged biscuits] according to the instructions on the box.

Heat the {canola oil} in a {large non-stick frying pan}. 
Make sure that the {pan}[large non-stick frying pan] can hold at least 3 cups of liquid, because eventually the {milk}[low-fat milk] is going into it.
Add the {sausage patties}[vegetarian sausage patties] and cook until they're browned. 
Remove from heat and allow to cool until they're comfortable to touch. 
Crumble the {patties}[vegetarian sausage patties] into &frac12;-inch pieces and return them to the {pan}[large non-stick frying pan].

Lightly spoon {flour}[all-purpose flour] into a {dry measuring cup} and level with a knife. 
Combine {flour}[all-purpose flour] and {milk}[low-fat milk] in a {large mixing bowl}, stirring with a {whisk or fork} until smooth.
Add milk mixture, {salt}, and {freshly ground black pepper} to {pan}[large non-stick frying pan]; bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Reduce heat and simmer for 3 minutes or until it's thick (drips slowly from {ladle}).

Place two {biscuits}[prepackaged biscuits] on each plate, and put the {pan}[large non-stick frying pan] with the gravy in the middle of the table with the {ladle} so people can put gravy on their own biscuits.

## Leftovers

If you store the gravy and biscuits separately in the fridge, you can keep it for a day or two afterwards. The gravy will thicken, but just stir in about a tablespoon of water per half-cup of gravy remaining. For two biscuits with a half-cup of gravy, microwave on high for 2&frac12; minutes.
